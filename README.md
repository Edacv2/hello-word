# print("Hello_word")

On this repo I will be adding the <b>.py</b> files that I modify on 
my <a href="https://astro-pi.org/">AstroPi</a>. Those programs can be found
on google easly, I took them and modify then to be use with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/">sense hat</a>.
Some are only tutorials that I do to practice.
