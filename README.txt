# hello-word

Im <b>Ed</b>, Im trying to learn Python and to use this 
tool with my small projects.

On this repo I will be adding the .py files that I create/modify on 
my AstroPi (https://astro-pi.org/). Those programs can be found
on google easly, I took them and modify then to be use with the sense hat.
